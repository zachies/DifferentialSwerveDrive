# Differential Swerve Drive
Implementation of four differential swerve drive modules. Used by FIRST Robotics Competition Team 2486, the CocoNuts, as a teaching tool. Currently uses the ARMABot swerve modules and Spark MAX motor controllers paired with the REV Robotics NEO motors.

Thanks to Team 5818 for providing the code necessary to drive a differential swerve module. Their repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Team5818/DiffSwerve).
